The positional accuracy of the Topographic database corresponds to that of scales 1:5 000 - 1:10 000.\n\nThe traffic road network and geographic names are updated constantly, buildings, constructions and administrative borders annually and the other elements approximately every 5\u201310 years. The Topographic database is available as a version covering the whole of Finland or as versions that cover a particular area or have specific data content.

  "lineageStatements": ["Regarding positional accuracy, the Topographic database is the NLS\u2019 most accurate dataset depicting the terrain and covering the whole country. The positional accuracy of the Topographic database corresponds to that of scales 1:5 000 - 1:10 000.\n\nThe Topographic database quality model describes the factors that comprise the quality of the numerical topographic data. In addition, it describes how the different quality factors are measured. The quality model also provides the quality requirements amongst other things for the positional accuracy, the up-dating frequency, the descriptive feature information and the coverage of topographic data. It does not include quality requirements concerning geometry and topology.\n \nDifferent objects of the Topographic database have different requirements for positional accuracy. For most man-made objects the requirement is 3 meters. The positional accuracy of the objects in the Topographic database is with a 95 percent probability in accordance with the minimum requirements stated in the quality model.\n\nThe up-to-date accuracy of the Topographic database depends on the object (see Maintenance). \n\nThe accuracy of descriptive information (feature information) varies depending on the object. For more accurate information, see descriptions of the different themes.\n\nThe size of coverage means the share of such objects that are missing from the database or that can be found in the database but not in the terrain. Different objects have different requirements for coverage. \n\nThe quality model (in Finnish): http://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/sites/default/files/Maastotietojen_laatumalli.pdf"],
